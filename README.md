https://automanager.blob.core.windows.net/wmclients/003490/images/eas-main-location-1.jpg
📌 Overview

Predicting the price of a used car is a complex task influenced by multiple factors such as brand, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and more.

This project applies Machine Learning Regression Techniques to accurately estimate car prices using real-world data.

Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, this project demonstrates the complete ML workflow:

Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis

Feature Engineering

Model Training

Performance Evaluation
